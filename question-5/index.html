			<h2 class="sub-heading">Mammals</h2>
			<p>
				Mammals include <b>humans</b> and all other animals that are
				warm-blooded vertebrates <i>(vertebrates have backbones)</i> with hair.
				They feed their young with milk and have a more well-developed brain
				than other types of animals.

			<h2 class="sub-heading">Aardvark</h2>
			<p>
				The aardvark gets its name from a South African word meaning "earth
				pig". Although the aardvark looks like a pig, especially with its body
				and snout, aardvarks actually share common ancestors with elephants and
				golden moles. Aardvarks live throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa.
